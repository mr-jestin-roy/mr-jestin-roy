      <h3>🚀 Senior Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
      <p align="justify">
        I am a results-driven ML specialist with <b>3+ years of prior production experience</b> building and deploying systems that drive revenue and scale reliably in real-world environments.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Prior to my Master’s, I served as a <b>production AI/ML engineer</b> shipping commercial systems. During my Master’s at Monash (2024–2026), I led <b>applied research & commercialisation contracts</b> for <b>University of Melbourne, Monash University, Murdoch University and the University of Warwick (UK)</b>—leveraging high-performance infrastructure (HPC, NVIDIA A100s) to bridge the gap between deep research and industrial production.
